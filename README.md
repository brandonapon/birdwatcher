# birdwatcher

## What is it?
birdwatcher is a project for CMPSC 293S: Internet of Things (Winter 2019) at UCSB with the goal of analyzing data from the ever so popular Bird electric scooter to recognize trends in hopes of performaing predicitive analysis.

## How did you come up with the name?
Bird is the company that provides the shareable electric scooters. We are essentially watching the activities of these scooters, therefore we are "birdwatchers"!

## What are the objectives of this project?
1. Parse and organize"useful" data from Bird data sets
2. Develop ML/DL algorithm that recognizes trends such as location hotspots, battery usage based on area, & etc, based on the previously gathered data.
3. Develop a Bird catching algorithm that maximizes the efficieny of the picking up and dropping off of birds based on the predicted usages.
4. Other findings?

## Is there any documentation available for this project?
Yes, we will publish our project report upon completion of this project.
